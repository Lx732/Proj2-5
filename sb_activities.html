            <h2>Summer and Benny's current interests</h2>
         <p>If you want a toy to disappear quickly and save a local small animal. Gift Summer a stuffed animal that resembles a local critter. Summer is a huntress.
She has enjoyed plushed chipmunks, ducks and squirrels. Since we introdunced her to these plushies we have recievd less hunted animals. Her favorite toy she protects and cares for the most is hot pink bone with a green squeaker ball built inside. No one is allowed to squeak it. She will cry. I think she thinks we will hurt it? She loves to cuddle with it and takes it with her everywhere in the house and the backyard. If you look to the left of the screen at the last photo listed. You will see Summer's snout. Her second favorite toy is a black and blue Nerf duck. She uses it as a pillow sometimes. She also enjoys catching it in the air. Summer is also very spoiled. She enjoys doggy massages from her godmother.</p>
                <br>
                
<p>Benny is your classic pup. He loves toys that make sounds like squeakers or crinkles. He loves interactive activities such as fetching a good ball or stick. Rope to tug of war with also interests him. Benny enjoys puppy baths and getting his paws wet and muddy.</p>
                
             <br><h2>Both enjoy Section</h2>
